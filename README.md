EXPERIMENTAL!

This is for demo purposes only.
Be a smart cookie and don't use experimental software in production.

What is Romano?
---------------
Romano is a very small but flexible framework, it share a lot of ideas from other frameworks but keeps them as compact as small as possible. By keeping it lightweight we save process time, money on your servers. This will also protect our selfs from over-expanding.
If you need a fat framework with lot's of bells and whistles , this is not it.

Requirements
------------
Romano only supports PHP 5.4 and up.

Yet another PHP Framework called Romano
---------------------------------------
Romano is my best and current attempt to learn PHP
As it has evolved a lot during my self training, pure in it's aspect.
it still needs a lot more global functionality before it would serve any useful purpose here on Github.

Experimental version
--------------------
The framework is not ment to be ready for public use as of today,
but serves more as a minor display of the Romano framework, a proof of concept.
The site blog example

Single project version
----------------------
The framework is currently delivered as a single project version meaning
all framework modules are located inside the app folder

here is an example of it's structure

			 /project
			 		/app  (dev side)
			 			/libs
			 			/models
			 			core.php
			 		/controllers

			 		/pub (front side)
			 			/css
			 			/img
			 			/js
			 			/index.php
			 		/template
			 		/views

			 		config.php

Setup
-----
rename the config.example.php to config.php and fill in the gaps
