What is Romano?
---------------
Romano is a very small but flexible framework, it share a lot of ideas from other frameworks but keeps them as compact as small as possible. By keeping it lightweight we save process time, money on your servers. This will also garantee ourselfs from overexpanding. If you need a big but fast framework, this is not it. Romano keeps only the most core functionality you can layer on top off.

------------
Romano is only supported on PHP 5.3.3 and up.
