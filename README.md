Yet another PHP Framework called Romano
---------------------------------------
Romano is my best and current attempt to learn PHP
As it has evolved a lot during my self training, pure in it's aspect.
it still needs a lot more global functionality before it would serve any useful purpose here on Github.

Experimental version
--------------------
The framework is not ment to be ready for public use as of today,
but serves more as a minor display of the Romano framework, a proof of concept.
The site blog example

Single project version
----------------------
The framework is currently delivered as a single project version meaning
all framework modules are located inside the app folder

here is an example of it's structure

			 /project
			 		/app  (dev side)
			 			/libs
			 			/models
			 			core.php
			 		/controllers

			 		/pub (front side)
			 			/css
			 			/img
			 			/js
			 			/index.php
			 		/template
			 		/views

			 		config.php

Setup
-----
rename the config.example.php to config.php and fill in the gaps
