What is Romano?
---------------
Romano is a very small but flexible framework, it share a lot of ideas from other frameworks but keeps them as compact as small as possible. By keeping it lightweight we save process time, money on your servers. This will also protect our selfs from over-expanding.
If you need a fat framework with lot's of bells and whistles , this is not it.

Romano only supports PHP 5.4 and up.
